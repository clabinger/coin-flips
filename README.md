# coin-flips

Inspired by Matt Parker's ["10 coin flips in a row" YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHU-L3BLd_w).

A simple JavaScript to simulate Matt's attempts at flipping a coin 10 times in a row with alternating head-tail results.

The script estimates the number of individual coin flips necessary to successfully perform the series, starting over from the first flip in the series each time the pattern is broken.

## Usage

Open coin-flips.html in a browser. Open the JavaScript console to see the results.
